    <h1>Moe, Kyle</h1>
    <p>I am an absolute beast at ping-pong as well as all 'bar games' for that matter. While I'm not certain about it, pretty sure I got some Canadian descent. Also, I've spent the last month living in a house with an unfinished basement because Boulder renters are degenerate fucks.<br>
    The reason I am studying computer science is rather simple. While I enjoyed what I was learning as a Physics student, I couldn't get over the fact that it didn't feel like much of it was truly applicable to what I'd do in the future. Thus I chose computer science to get some work applying the science I know because it's the closest I can get to engineering without taking their classes.</p>
